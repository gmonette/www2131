# TODO:
# 
# - First: possible ask list of questions for different students to answer
#   based on vocabular study.
#   Idea; Different students use same methodology so those lacking will
#   get help from others.
# 
# - look at notes in Quire for changes to description, e.g.
#   - require cameras for oral test
#   - in class 1 hour midterm and 2 hour final if inclass possible, otherwise
#     a 30 minute oral individually scheduled for both
#   - weekly quiz, in class on laptop with access to web to equalize
#     for students not in class
#   - sould I change to markdown to facilitate citations:
#   - add reading and sumarizzing a paper
#   - add contributed links should be accompanied with a note describing
#     why the link is interesting and providing a critique.
#   - front row team as before, your participation is much appreciated
#     and makes a big difference to the lecturer.
#   - Lescture will be on zomm. Class attendance is expected and participation
#     in class or via chat, etc, which students can use in class also is encouraged
#   - make sure speakers not active on your lapttop if you use zoom in class;
#     a good trick is to plug earbuds in your laptop to avoid deafening feedback
#     loops
#   - Team Project: differen students work on different aspects of a problem
#     and then combine their work into a common project and presentation to
#     be recorded on Zoom and will be posted for class.
#   - Two Other teams comment independently??
# What do do about SAS. Might have time this year due to early start.

#' ### __Assignment 1__ (individual): Connecting with your team.
#' 
#' __Due Thursday, January 11, 9 pm__
#' 
#' - Join Piazza using the invitation sent to your yorku.ca email address.
#' - Get to know your team members. Post a message private to your team introducing yourself. What statistics
#'   courses have you taken? What programming languages do you know? Are you
#'   interested in particular applications of statistics, etc? Use the folder 'assn1'.
#' - Reply and comment on your team members' postings.
#' 
#' - Topic 1 --again: How harmful is smoking?
#'   - This is the [link to the R script used for the lecture.](files/Intro/Smoking.R)
#'
#'    
##- Day 3 ------
#'
#' ## __Day 3__: Friday, January 14
#' 
#' __Important:__ A few of you have not yet registered with Piazza and a few
#' who have registered have not yet sent an introductory message to their team.
#' You must send an introductory message for your team to know who you are.
#' Please __complete this today by 9pm__ at the very latest. Send me email at
#' georges@yorku.ca if you encounter technical obstacles.
#' 
#' __Chapters 1 and 2 of the textbook:__
#' 
#' - [Summary of Chapters 1 and 2 -- in progress](files/Chapters-1-2/Review.pdf)
#' - The first two chapters should be mainly a review of MATH 2030, occasionally
#'   going a bit deeper.
#' - The first few lectures will go through the first two chapters, highlighting
#'   key concepts and working on some exercises.
#' 
#' __Quiz on Wednesday, January 17:__
#' 
#' - In-class 10-minute paper quiz lasting 10 minutes, starting at 12:05 pm.
#' - Bring a blank sheet of paper, the question(s) will be shown on the screen.
#' - At the start of the quiz, the sheet should be blank except for your name 
#'   and student number.
#' - In fairness to your classmates, you __must stop writing__ when the end
#'   of the quiz is announced.
#' - If your grade on the final exam is higher than your quiz grade, for any
#'   quiz, then the grade on the final exam is substituted for your quiz
#'   grade.  Since the weight of missed quizzes is automatically transferred
#'   to your final exam, this rule is designed so you can't be penalized
#'   for choosing to write a quiz.
#' - I will discuss possible quiz questions during the lecture.   
#' 
#' __Formula sheet for the midterm and final exam:__
#' 
#' See this [Piazza post](https://piazza.com/class/lpxid3wmydd7kh/post/103) where
#' you can collectively create a formula sheet for the midterm and for the
#' final exam. As long as it can be printed on two pages, it will be included
#' in the midterm and in the final exam.  Of course, its contents might change
#' between the midterm and final.
#'  
##- ### Assignment 2 (team): ------
#' ### __Assignment 2__ (team): How harmful is smoking?
#' 
#' __Deadline:__ Wednesday, January 17, 8pm
#' 
#' Collectively with your team, discuss what principles are illustrated
#' by the Life Expectancy versus Smoking example. 
#' 
#' - What do they imply about the interpretation of statistical analyses?
#' - Some people would call the positive association between Smoking and Life Expectancy
#'   in the data we analyzed a _spurious association_. Yet it was a mathematically
#'   correctly computed association. Is the association itself really spurious? 
#'   What are people trying to say when they say it's spurious?
#'   How would you tell a spurious association from a non-spurious association?
#'   Is an association spurious just because you don't like it?
#' - When can an association between two variables be used as evidence
#'   that one variable causes the other? What's the difference between
#'   using a variable to 'predict', i.e 'guess', the value of another variable
#'   in contrast with concluding that intervening by changing one variable will result
#'   in a change of the other.       
#' - Prepare a statement on Piazza, private to your team, that expresses your team's opinion,
#'   by the deadline.
#' - Use the folder 'assn_2'.
#' - After the deadline, you may make your post public to the class. The instructors
#'   might comment and make some selected posts public.  
#'   
##- ### Assignment 3 (team): Chapters 1 and 2 ------
#' ### __Assignment 3__ (team): Connecting with your team.

#'   about using LaTeX on Piazza.
#'   Add other resources to it if you find some.
#' - Assign each person in your group a number starting from 1 to the number
#'   of members in the group.  Use your alphabetical order based on your 
#'   first name.  If others join later, give them higher numbers, don't renumber
#'   the current members.
#' - Depending on your number, do the questions below by deadline 1 and
#'   post them on Piazza.
#'     - Use the folder 'assn_3'.
#'     - __Important:__ Use a __separate post__ for each question
#'       and use the title: 'Chapter X Problem Y' where X is the
#'       chapter number and Y is the problem number. Be sure to leave spaces
#'       exactly as shown.  Why should you do it this way? 
#'       Because when solutions are made public, you will be able to find
#'       all the solutions to the same problem together.

##- ### Assignment 5 (optional) ------
#' 
#' ### __Assignment 5__ (optional):
#' 
#' Some of you have requested exercises to practice R. These are
#' R assignments from a higher-level course but you are welcome to explore
#' them and discuss them on Piazza. There is no grade for trying this nor
#' a penalty for not doing so.
#' 
#' First, you should install R and RStudio for your operating system. 
#' 
#' It's challenging to find a good way to
#' 'learn R'.  It depend on where you are and where
#' you want to go. Now, there's a plethora of on-line
#' courses. See the blog post:
#' [The 5 Most Effective Ways to Learn R](https://www.r-bloggers.com/the-5-most-effective-ways-to-learn-r/) 
#' 
#' In my opinion, ultimately, the best way is to

#' - __play__ your way through the 'official' 
#'   [manuals on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html) 
#'   starting with 'An Introduction to R' along with
#'   'R Data Import/Export'. Note however that these materials
#'   were developed before the current mounting concern
#'   with reproducible research and some of the advice
#'   should be deprecated, e.g. using 'attach' and
#'   'detach' with data.frames.
#' - read the 
#'   [CRAN task views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views) 
#'   in areas that interest you.
#' - Have a look at the over 500,000 questions tagged 'r' on
#'   [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r?tab=newest&page=1&pagesize=15). 
#' - At every opportunity, use R Markdown documents to work on assignments, project, 
#'   etc.
#'    
#' Using R is like playing the piano. You can read and learn
#' all the theory you want, ultimately you learn by __playing__.
#'
#' We will discuss 
#' the script 
#' [CAR_1.R](R/CAR_1/CAR_1.R). Copy it to a file in RStudio
#' and __play__ with it line by line. You can also run
#' the entire script with _Control-Shift-K_ to see how
#' scripts can be used for reproducible research.
